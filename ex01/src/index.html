              kilometres (26 miles 385 yards), usually run as a road race. The event was
              instituted in commemoration of the fabled run of the Greek soldier
              Pheidippides, a messenger from the Battle of Marathon to Athens, who
              reported the victory. The marathon can be completed by running or with a
              run/walk strategy. There are also wheelchair divisions. The marathon was one of the 
              original modern Olympic events in 1896, though
              the distance did not become standardized until 1921. ore than 800
              marathons are held throughout the world each year, with the vast majority
              of competitors being recreational athletes, as larger marathons can have
              tens of thousands of participants."
